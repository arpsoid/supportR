# supportR
Functions in R that support stochastic modelling and matrix-analytic methods

These files/functions are related to stochastic models of parallel processing systems such as high-performance and distributed computing systems. 

Several of them are related to matrix-analytic models and may be of help while studying those.

To install this package use
```R
devtools::install_github('arpsoid/supportR')
```
